# 2025 Computercraft LLM Lab

This project is a workspace for the LLM hands-on lab activity!
The course materials can be found [here](https://dmice.ohsu.edu/bedricks/courses/cc_llm_summer_2025/); this directory contains the following resources:

- `workbook.qmd`: A Quarto workbook whose structure mirrors the various checkpoints in the lab documents linked above
- `lit_review.xlsx`: The literature search results dataset that you will be working with

The project itself is using [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage its package dependencies; hopefully this will make it easier to install the (minimal) set of libraries required.
